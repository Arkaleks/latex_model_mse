# Template-LaTeX

LaTeX template for MSE semester and thesis reports.

## Getting Started

This template provides a LaTeX class which simply replaces and extends the standard directive `report`.

### Without Git
This template is based on (https://github.com/njakob/template-latex/releases) and modified for my needs. Thanks to Nicolas Jakob

This updated model is available at (https://github.com/gremaudc/latex_model_mse)

*It is recommended that you configure your workspace as shown below, then it will be easy to keep it updated.*

### Clone this Repository

Create a new folder for your report, then run git clone command.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:gremaudc/latex_model_mse.git
```

Now you can start to write your report in `thesis.tex`.

### Setup your Own Repository

Create a new folder for your report, and then initialize your repository as usual.

```shell
$ git init
$ git remote add origin <remote-location-of-your-git>
```

Now you can start to write your report in `thesis.tex`.
